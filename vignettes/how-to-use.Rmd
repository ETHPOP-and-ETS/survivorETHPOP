```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We'll need to calculate these curves by calculating the proportion of people in each age, sex, ethnicity group who die each year (with those who emigrate being censored, of course).
Of course, we'll need a separate survivorship curve for each year of birth, as life expectancy changes over time.
I expect there to be sex differences; if ethnicity doesn't make a difference then we can aggregate across ethnicity.

cumulative

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

survivor_curve()

```
